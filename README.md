# Project#4 in Udacity Front-End Web Development Nanodegree

the project's flow is as follow:
- Ask the user to enter an URL.
- Check the URL whether it matches a regex or not.
- if the URL matches the regex, the URL will be sent to meaning cloud API to sentimentally analyze it
and the user interface will be updated with (confidence, agreement, and subjectivity).
- if the URL does not match the regex, the user will be asked to re-enter a valid one.

The project contains the starter code provided by Udacity and the modified and the new files by me.
